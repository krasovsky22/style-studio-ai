## Token System Implementation Strategy

#### Database Design for Tokens

The token system requires careful database design to ensure accuracy and prevent token theft:

##### Key Tables:

1. **Users Table**

   - `tokenBalance`: Current available tokens
   - `totalTokensPurchased`: Lifetime token purchases
   - `totalTokensUsed`: Lifetime token usage
   - `freeTokensGranted`: Free tokens given to user

2. **TokenPurchases Table**

   - Tracks all token purchases with Stripe integration
   - Includes purchase amount, tokens received, and transaction status
   - Links to Stripe payment intent for verification

3. **Generations Table**

   - `tokensUsed`: Number of tokens consumed (1 for success, 0 for failure)
   - Links generation cost to token consumption

4. **TokenTransactions Table** (Future Enhancement)
   - Detailed log of all token movements
   - Supports refunds, bonuses, and transfers

#### Token Security Measures

1. **Atomic Operations**: Token deduction and generation creation in single transaction
2. **Balance Validation**: Check sufficient tokens before starting generation
3. **Failure Handling**: Refund tokens if generation fails
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of token usage for support

#### Token Purchase Flow

1. User selects token package
2. Stripe checkout session created
3. Payment processed by Stripe
4. Webhook confirms payment
5. Tokens added to user balance
6. Purchase recorded in database
7. User notified of successful purchase
